My mid-covid high school Javascript class portfolio that'll make you go "Wow, this kid was weird growing up". In my defense, I thought obscure jpegs littered across my site was peak comedy at the time.

I learned javascript for the OperationSpark certification. This class was a seriously cool intro to programming for me, specifically how websites work. It solidified my choice to pick computer science in college.

Later after this class, while I still has access to my high school email and gitlab enviorment, I expirimented with runnning [[OS.js]] locally. It was fun using what little skill I had me to mess around with something I knew pretty much nothing about and learn about a use-case for javascript beyond basic web dev.
